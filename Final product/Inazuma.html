            <h2>Inazuma - Tale of Five Kasen</h2>
            <pre>
                Five poets who were excellent at poetry, who once existed in Lightning. 
                These poets left behind many anecdotes, 
                and after overcoming many twists and turns, 
                the storm seemed to have calmed down.
                Five talented people have now appeared 
                in Shion's garden and investigate the matter once again. 
                Based on the truth that was revealed, the old story was rewritten.
